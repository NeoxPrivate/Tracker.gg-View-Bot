### What's New in This Modified Version?
* **Increased Spoofer Efficiency**: Enhanced spoofing techniques for bypassing the "patch" implemented by tracker.gg.
* **cf_clearance Cookie Bypass**: Fully functional bypass for Cloudflare’s cf_clearance cookie verification.
* **Optimized Session Management**: Supports 50-100 sessions/minute with improved performance.

These modifications build on Zaptons’ original work. **All credit goes to Zaptons** for the base code and its functionality. My contributions involve adding the new bypasses to ensure the tool remains operational.

## About the Project

This project serves as a **base** but remains easy to modify for individual needs. The original intent of the project was to provide an affordable and effective way to enhance tracker.gg profiles, helping users generate high views using proxies.

Unfortunately, earlier versions were misused, resold as "viewbotting as a service," and monetized. Despite these setbacks, this updated version is shared for educational and personal use. **Enjoy responsibly!**

> **Important Note**: Basic questions like:
> - "Where do I put the proxies?"
> - "Why does it not load?"
> - "How do I run it?"
>
> **Please use ChatGPT or Google for such queries.** I will only provide technical assistance for advanced issues or on a VPS setup for a $10 fee to minimize spam.

### Why was this project created?
* Affordable and accessible method to improve tracker profiles.
* First publicly available solution for viewbotting on tracker.gg.
* High demand for such a project among tracker.gg users.
